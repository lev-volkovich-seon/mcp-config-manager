## Installation

```bash
# Install globally from npm
npm install -g mcp-config-manager
```

Alternatively, you can clone the project and run it locally:

```bash
# Clone or download the project
cd mcp-config-manager

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Make CLI globally available (optional)
npm link
```

## Usage

### CLI Commands

```bash
# List all clients and their status
mcp-config-manager list

# Show servers for a specific client
mcp-config-manager show claude

# Add a new server
mcp-config-manager add claude my-server -c npx -a "-y" "@example/server" -e API_KEY=abc123

# Remove a server from one client
mcp-config-manager remove claude my-server

# Remove a server from ALL clients
mcp-config-manager remove all my-server

# Copy server between clients
mcp-config-manager copy claude my-server cursor

# Copy server to ALL other clients
mcp-config-manager copy claude my-server all

# Manage environment variables
mcp-config-manager env claude my-server set API_KEY new-value
mcp-config-manager env claude my-server unset API_KEY
mcp-config-manager env claude my-server list

# Export/Import configurations
mcp-config-manager export claude config.json
mcp-config-manager export claude --server my-server server-config.json
mcp-config-manager import cursor config.json

# Start web UI
mcp-config-manager web
# or
npm run web
```

**Note:** `mcp-manager` also works as a shorter alias for `mcp-config-manager`.

### Web UI

**Start the web server:**
```bash
# If installed globally
mcp-config-manager web

# If running from cloned repository
npm run web

# Custom port (default is 3456)
PORT=3457 npm run web
```

Then open http://localhost:3456 in your browser.

The web UI provides:
- **Client auto-discovery**: Automatically detects clients with existing configurations on startup, with a refresh button to scan for more.
- **List View**: Traditional interface with detailed server management
  - Multi-select checkboxes for bulk delete operations
  - Remove from all clients button for each server
  - Bulk action toolbar with select all/none options
- **Kanban View**: Drag-and-drop servers between clients
  - Full functionality on cards (edit, copy, export, delete)
  - Visual icons for quick actions
  - Drag to copy servers between clients
- **Server View**: Consolidated view of all servers across clients
  - Shows which clients each server is configured for
  - Bulk operations to add servers to multiple clients
- **Remote MCP Support**: Dedicated "Add Remote MCP" button for easy setup
  - Simply provide server name and remote URL
  - Automatically generates `npx mcp-remote [URL]` configuration
  - Perfect for connecting to hosted MCP services
- **JSON Editor**: Toggle between form and raw JSON editing
- **Multi-select Copy**: Copy servers to multiple clients at once

## Supported Clients

This tool supports auto-detection of any client that follows the Model Context Protocol specification. The following is a non-exhaustive list of clients that have been tested and are known to work:

- **Amazon Q Developer**: `~/.aws/amazonq/mcp.json`
- **Claude Desktop**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Claude Code**: `.mcp.json` in project root
- **Cline**: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`
- **Cursor**: `.cursor/mcp.json` (project-specific) or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (global)
- **Factory Bridge**: `~/Library/Application Support/Factory Bridge/mcp.json`
- **Gemini**: `~/.gemini/settings.json`
- **Roo Code**: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`
- **VS Code**: `.vscode/mcp.json`
- **Windsurf**: `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` or `~/AppData/Roaming/WindSurf/mcp_settings.json` (Windows)

*Note: Paths may vary based on your operating system. The tool will attempt to find the correct path automatically.*

## Configuration Format

Standard MCP server configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "server-name": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@example/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "your-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Security Note

Environment variables may contain sensitive data like API keys. The tool masks values containing "KEY" or "SECRET" in the display but stores them in plain text in config files.

## Development & Testing

```bash
# 1. Make your changes to the code

# 2. Run tests to verify everything works

# 5. Push to repository
git push

# 6. Publish to npm (maintainers only)
npm version patch  # or minor/major
npm publish
```

### Running Tests

The project includes comprehensive test coverage:

```bash
# Run all tests (CLI + UI)
npm test

# Run CLI tests only (17 tests)
npm run test:cli

# Run UI tests only (2 tests) - requires Playwright
npm run test:ui

# Run specific test file
npx mocha test/ui-simple.test.js --timeout 30000
```

### Test Coverage

- **CLI Tests**: 17/17 âœ… - Comprehensive command-line functionality testing
- **UI Tests**: 2/2 âœ… - Frontend integration and API communication testing
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end dual-mode form/JSON editing validation

### Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies (includes Playwright for UI testing)
npm install

# Install Playwright browsers (for UI tests)
npx playwright install chromium

# Start development server with mock data
MCP_USE_MOCK_CLIENTS=true npm run web

# Run server on custom port
PORT=3457 npm run web
```

### Testing with Mock Clients

For development and testing, you can use mock clients:

```bash
# Enable mock client mode
export MCP_USE_MOCK_CLIENTS=true

# Start server (will use test clients instead of real ones)
npm run web
```

This allows testing functionality without affecting real MCP client configurations.
